{"name":"Tntlive","tagline":"A Translation of the Open Source TNT Basic Runtime to Javascript","body":"### TNTLive(s).\r\n\r\nTNT Basic was originally a Mac application written by Mark Tully and John Treece Birch, many, many moons ago. It was a fantastic piece of kit that I had a lot of fun playing around with. It was based on Francois Lionnet's AMOS (and STOS) basic from the good old Amiga / Atari days, and I did a lot of work with STOS back then.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found on the official [TNT Basic Pages](tntbasic.com).\r\n\r\nIn the last few years there have been giant leaps forward in web based technologies, and a fundamental shift in the way software is used and distributed, moving from the traditional desktop model to a far more dynamic and accessible internet paradigm.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
